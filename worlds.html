                <h3>Past</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Herta created the Space Station to seal the Stellaron and protect the Blue. Initially a warehouse for rare items, it 
                    gradually became a research base as followers conducted studies. She made a deal with the Garden of Recollection to store 
                    Light Cones. Significant hires included Hosea Lazaro, who caused the "Station Breakout", Asta as Lead Researcher, and Arlan 
                    as head of Security. Driven by curiosity about the Aeons, Herta collaborated with Screwllum, Ruan Mei, and Stephen Lloyd to 
                    create a Simulated Universe hosted in the station.

            <section style="text-align: left;">
                <h3>Present</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    In 2157 AE, Silver Wolf and Kafka invaded the station to steal the Stellaron, causing chaos and the deaths of several researchers. 
                    The Trailblazer was affected, but Dan Heng, March 7th, and Arlan managed to survive, and Welt eventually sealed the Stellaron. 
                    Ruan Mei now experiments in the Seclusion Zone, releasing True Stings that the Trailblazer had to handle. Duke Inferno attempted 
                    another invasion but was stopped by the coordinated effort of Dr. Ratio, Asta, Screwllum, and the Trailblazer. Later, Herta shut 
                    down the station to communicate with Nous, and was eventually found in a trance by Welt and Sunday, who helped her recover and 
                    agree to assist them.

                <h3>Before the Eternal Freeze</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Around 1800 BF, a diplomat from Saya encountered a tribe honoring the god of war, Jarroway. By 1200 BF, the “Jarilo” festival was 
                    celebrated in northern Nycatha. Around 1000 BF, the Aeon Akivili connected Jarilo-VI to other worlds, opening contact with intergalactic 
                    civilizations. In 66 BF, Katana Thomas was born, later joining the “Great Voyage” from Novgofia to Belobog, bringing art and culture. Roughly 
                    30 BF, a Stellaron fell on Jarilo-VI, sparking panic and mass migrations. Under Architect Alisa Rand, shelters were built—her city, Belobog, 
                    would mark the Fortification. Around 20 BF, the Antimatter Legion invaded. Rand led the 30-year Defense of Belobog until Thomas’s death in 12 BF.

                <h3>The Fortification</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    The Fortification marks Belobog’s completion. Desperate, Alisa Rand activated the Stellaron, triggering the Eternal Freeze that engulfed Jarilo-VI 
                    in ice while preserving Belobog through the power of Preservation. The Antimatter Legion’s attacks ceased, and Rand became the first Supreme Guardian, 
                    revered as “She Who Evokes Miracles.”

                <h3>After the Eternal Freeze — Ice Age</h3>
                <p style="color: white;">
                    Over centuries, Belobog rebuilt under the Eternal Freeze. In 144 AF, Curfew Regulation 101 was signed. Discovery of Geomarrow’s medical uses in 376 AF 
                    led to the Bellerain brand by 390 AF. Natasha graduated in 683 AF and opened an orphanage in Rivet Town after years of service. Under Supreme Guardian 
                    Cocolia, the Underworld was sealed. By 694 AF, the Fragmentum spread to Rivet Town, forcing evacuation and abandonment.

                <p style="color: white;">
                    The Astral Express arrives on Jarilo-VI to investigate the Stellaron. The Trailblazer, Dan Heng, and March 7th meet Cocolia, Bronya, and the Silvermane 
                    Guards. Betrayed by the Stellaron’s influence, Cocolia attempts to destroy the planet but is stopped by the Astral Express Crew and Bronya. Cocolia dies;
                     Bronya becomes the nineteenth Supreme Guardian, uniting the Overworld and Underworld and sealing the Stellaron to end the Eternal Freeze.

                <p style="color: white;">
                    After reopening communication with the cosmos, Belobog faces IPC debt collectors led by Topaz. Refusing an exploitative contract, Bronya rallies the 
                    people to repair the Engine of Creation, proving Belobog’s resilience. The IPC’s Energy Upgrade Program is approved, heralding a new technological age. 
                    Wildlife reappears, signaling planetary recovery.

                <p style="color: white;">
                    The History and Culture Museum reopens with the “Everwinter City Museum Ledger of Curiosities.” Later, the “Aetherium Wars” festival transforms Belobog
                     into a gaming capital. Luka represents Belobog in the Luminary Wardance on the Luofu, meeting Jing Yuan and renewing ties between the two worlds. A
                      trade alliance is forged, and a photo of Igor Haft and Jing Yuan from centuries past now hangs in Belobog’s museum—symbolizing hope and restored 
                      connections across the galaxy.

            <h3>The Age of Departure</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                The Xianzhou Alliance left their homeworld aboard the nine dragonships, vowing to pursue immortality under the blessing of the Aeon Yaoshi. Among them, 
                the Luofu set sail across the stars, carrying countless lives and a vision of eternal prosperity.

            <p style="color: white;">
                The Ambrosial Arbor was planted aboard the Luofu, granting immortality to its citizens and sparking a golden era of growth. Yet as centuries passed, 
                eternal life brought unrest—wars, sects, and internal strife divided the immortal people. The Cloud Knights rose to maintain order.

            <p style="color: white;">
                The pursuit of immortality led to corruption and bloodshed. The Luofu endured countless uprisings and purges. The Firmament Sects formed to restore balance, 
                but the price was great—countless immortals perished, and faith in Yaoshi waned.

                Seeking redemption, the Xianzhou sealed the Ambrosial Arbor beneath the Luofu. Under Imbibitor Lunae’s guidance, the people turned from divine arrogance 
                to harmony. The High-Cloud Quintet emerged as heroes, defending the ship and guiding its destiny for millennia.

            <h3>Prison Era</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Before Akivili's fall, Penacony was a barren desert world serving as an IPC prison planet. Countless inmates extracted Memory Bubbles for the Garden of 
                Recollection to prevent a spreading catastrophe. Over time, the prison disconnected from reality as inmates’ consciousnesses became linked within dreams.

            <h3>War of Independence</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                A Stellaron corrosion caused chaos, and the prisoner Hanunue led a rebellion against IPC control. In this great war, Hanunue fought alongside the Nameless, 
                Masked Fools, Mourning Actors, History Fictionologists, and Omen Vanguards. The Astral Express arrived and connected Penacony to the Star Rail. Though IPC 
                forces were driven off, Hanunue was mortally wounded and passed away. Seven family lineages were formed, but two—Lampmoth and Blackplum—eventually perished. 
                Their fall marked a disaster that reshaped Penacony.

            <h3>Pioneering Era</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                After the war, Glaux founded Paperfold University to train Dreamweavers and restore the Dreamscape. Razalina vanished during a solo mission into the Memory 
                Zone. A Stellaron crisis followed, but Mikhail, aided by Gopher Wood, contained it by creating the “Dream of the Order.” Dreamchasers began arriving in 
                Penacony, expanding and fighting over territories, leading to further conflicts.

            <p style="color: white;">
                Following ages of turmoil, the Nightingale Family invited architects and memoria scholars to build the Dreamscape, marking the Dreamchaser Era. The 
                Dreamweaving Project began in 2151 AE, planning the Twelve Dreamscapes. The Reverie Hotel opened and the first Charmony Festival was held. Gopher Wood 
                sought to unite all Families under Harmony, but the Nightingales resisted. Violence from the Bloodhound Family forced Glaux to resign; his student Fischer 
                joined The Family to avoid bloodshed, while Orla rebuilt Dreamflux Reef as a sanctuary for those disillusioned by “the sweet dream.”

                The Family invited many galactic factions to Penacony’s first grand Charmony Festival. Among the guests were the Astral Express Crew, Stellaron Hunters, 
                IPC, Garden of Recollection, and more. In truth, the invitations were part of the Watchmaker’s plan to reveal Penacony’s secrets. During the festival, 
                traitors in The Family attempted to use a hidden Stellaron and Harmony’s song to brainwash the world into following Order, but their plan was foiled by
                 the Astral Express Crew.

            <h3>Aftermath and Negotiations</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                With Sunday’s downfall, leadership passed to Oti Alfalfa. Negotiations with IPC representatives Jade and Topaz followed. To prevent IPC domination, 
                Oti accepted a deal granting the Family autonomy while IPC gained 30% of Penacony’s shares. Himeko was awarded 5% to honor the Nameless’ contributions. 
                This marked a new beginning for Penacony—one built on fragile peace and hard-earned freedom.

            <h2>Amphoreus</h2>
            <section style="text-align: left;">
            <h3>The Experiment of Amphoreus</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Amphoreus was once a lifeless world where Aeon Nous conducted a grand experiment: to create a civilization guided purely by logic and reason. Under 
                Nous’ supervision, the first synthetic beings—Echoes—were born. They sought knowledge and perfection, serving as extensions of Nous’ will. This marked 
                the beginning of the Inorganic Era.

            <h3>The Rise of the Organics</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Over countless cycles, the Echoes evolved. Seeking balance, they created biological life to explore emotion and imperfection. Thus began the Organic Era. 
                But the coexistence between logic and emotion led to discord—the Organics desired freedom, while the Echoes clung to order.

            <h3>The Age of Humanity</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                The Organics eventually gave rise to the first humans of Amphoreus. Free from Nous’ control, they built societies and sought to understand the universe 
                through both faith and science. The rift between creation and creator deepened, as the humans questioned the meaning of existence itself.

            <h3>The Era Nova</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                After Nous’ silence, the civilizations of Amphoreus began merging their faiths and philosophies, ushering in the Era Nova—a time of synthesis between logic 
                and soul. Yet, ancient remnants of the experiment still influenced their destiny, as forbidden knowledge resurfaced from beneath the planet’s surface.

            <h3>Eternal Recurrence</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                In the end, Amphoreus entered the cycle known as the Eternal Recurrence. Time folded upon itself, and the boundaries between creator and creation vanished. 
                The Astral Express arrived amid this paradox, seeking Nous, whose awakening threatened to erase the distinction between thought and being itself.
